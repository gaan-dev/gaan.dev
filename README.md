#### Where
[gaan.dev](www.gaan.dev)
#### Why?
I've been struggling to get a complete project done and up and usable. This is as simple as they come, a craft cms project with one channel type that I can put my thoughts in, make a few rants about, and easily expand in the future as I need.

## Technologies
Craft CMS
