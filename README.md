# gaan.dev Craft Project
#### Where
[gaan.dev](www.gaan.dev)
#### Why?
I've been struggling to get a complete project done and up and usable. This is as simple as they come, a craft cms project with one channel type that I can put my thoughts in, make a few rants about, and easily expand in the future as I need.

## Technologies
1. Craft CMS
2. Tailwind CSS

## Installation
This project makes use of the project config stuff that craft released about 2 years ago and look like they've recently upgraded to remove a lot of the issues with conflics between repo and live environment.

# Requirements
1. Empty Database
2. PHP installation
3. Composer

```
git clone https://github.com/gaan-dev/gaan.dev.git
cd gaan.dev
composer install
./craft setup
```

And follow the Wizard through with the required credentials.

You can then access the admin panel at `/admin`, enter using your credentials and play around with the articles section/entry.
